This Repository is dedicated to the controls team for the UF Theme Park Engineering and Design Club. 
Within this project we our designing a small-scale working model of a roller coaster that we designed 
and built from scratch.

<h2>Things to do:</h2>
-Completed-Create a diagram to show how the controls system will run<br />
-Completed-Develop prgram to handle one train<br />
-Completed-Test Sensors with one train<br />
-Completed-Develop prgram to handle multiple trains<br />
-Completed-Test Sensors with multiple trains<br />
-Completed-Write the software to run motors<br />
-Completed-write software for different modes<br />
-In Progress-Write the software to switch modes<br />
-In Progress-Add more sensors to add safety redundency <br />
-In Progress-Develop design for control box<br />
-Buy buttons<br />
-Test the system to ensure everything works<br />
-Create a separate program that will operate show equipment (LEDs, Sounds etc)<br />
-Make TPED Website<br />
-Make TPED App<br />

<h3>Different Modes</h3>
-Display Mode- Will continue to run for a given amount of time with no action needed<br />
-Manual Mode- Will only allow the next coaster to go when an input is given<br />
-Maintnance Mode-Will turn on specific motors on comand<br />


<h2>Getting Started?</h2>
Here are some things to download before working on programming the logic behind the coaster.<br />
To be able to push and pull from this repository to your local machine we use git and gitBash<br />
https://git-scm.com/downloads<br />
once you download git you could then create a folder for your TPED files, rightclick inside the folder and select "Git Bash Here". With your GitHub username and email fill in the following command:<br /><br />
git config --global user.name "Your name here"<br />
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"<br /><br />
At this point you can now clone the repository onto your local machine using the link from this page when clicking the green button and the following command:<br /><br />
git clone HTTP_URL_FROM_GREEN_BUTTON<br /><br />
Now you have all the files we have been working on.
next we will need to download the IDE for arduino to be able to run are program<br />
