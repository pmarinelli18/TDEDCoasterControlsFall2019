This Repository is dedicated to the controls team for the UF Theme Park Engineering and Design Club. 
Within this project we our designing a small-scale working model of a roller coaster that we designed 
and built from scratch.


Things to do:<br />
-Create a diagram to show how the controls system will run<br />
-Write the software will be running the model<br />
-Test the system to ensure everything works<br />
-Wire buttons and switches to create a control panel<br />
-Create a separate program that will operate show equipment (LEDs, Sounds etc)<br />
Different Modes<br />
-Normal Mode<br />
-Display Mode<br />
-Manual Mode<br />
